                <h2 class="big">PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                <p>Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website
                    to sell products and services to customers. [1]<br><br>There is open source software for web development like
                    BerkeleyDB, Glassfish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has the kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum.
                    Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been rise of the easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and
                    Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software, but
                    the basics can be learned and implemented quickly with the help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials, or face-to-face
                    training.<br><br>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and
                    interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally only available as
                    application on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information and media
                    distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs. These web
                    services allow user to interact with applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for
                    their application environment.</p>

                <h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h3>
                <P>Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web development include e-commerce.
                    Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services. Online
                    retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many
                    consumers.</P>
